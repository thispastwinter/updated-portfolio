           I'm currently a student at the University of Kansas Edwards Campus. I'm studying full-stack web developement
           through KU's Coding Bootcamp. My specialties are in front end web development, with particular interest in CSS. 
           While not necessarily one of my stongpoints, I do have a very good understanding of javascript, especially as it
           pertains to dynamically generated content. I also have a good grasp on API's and other databases, including Firebase.

           My hope with those who stumble across this page is a sense of simplicity. My focus is on creating web pages that 
           are functional while also maintaining minimal design. This webpage is a testament to that. It's minimal, but also
           not bland. It also maintains its own identity, and while it utilizes some of materializes css framework, it isn't 
           a "cookie cutter" layout. Please feel free to look through my portfolio while you're here, and don't hesitate to 
           contact me!
