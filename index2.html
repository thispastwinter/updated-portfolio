      <br>
      <h3>A web developer ready to make your vision come to life.</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Kansas Edwards Campus. I'm studying full-stack web developement
        through KU's Coding Bootcamp. My specialties are in front end web development, with particular interest in CSS.
        While not necessarily one of my stongpoints, I do have a very good understanding of javascript, especially as it
        pertains to dynamically generated content. I also have a good grasp on API's and other databases, including
        Firebase.</p>
      <p>
        My hope with those who stumble across this page is a sense of simplicity. My focus is on creating web pages that
        are functional while also maintaining minimal design. This webpage is a testament to that. It's minimal, but
        also
        not bland. It also maintains its own identity, and while it utilizes some of materializes css framework, it
        isn't
        a "cookie cutter" layout. Please feel free to look through my portfolio while you're here, and don't hesitate to
        contact me!
